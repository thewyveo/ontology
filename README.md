# Knowledge and Data 2024: Final Assignment

## Overview
This project aims to analyze anxiety disorders and show connections between environmental and biological risk factors using an ontology represented in Turtle format. The analysis includes querying the data, and visualizing patient demographics, risk factors, sleep disturbances, and genetic markers associated with anxiety disorders. 

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - `rdflib`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`
  - `seaborn`
  - `networkx`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Notebook and Ontology File**
   Download both files into the same directory:
   - `Notebook.ipynb` (the Jupyter Notebook)
   - `FinalOntology.ttl` (the ontology file)

2. **Open the Notebook**
   Open `Notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or in your IDE

3. **Run the Notebook**
   - Run each cell in the notebook in order so to avoid errors
  
4. **Visualizations and Outputs**
   The notebook will save plots as pngs in the same directory as the notebook when the visualisation blocks are ran, including:
   - `query1.png`
   - `query2.png`
   - `query3.png`
   - `query4_scatter.png`
   - `query4_stacked.png`
   - `query5.png`

## Notes
- Make sure the ontology file `FinalOntology.ttl` is in the same directory as the notebook and has the correct name to avoid file not found errors
